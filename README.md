# 🚀 AMS-02 Research Demo

This repository documents my self-guided journey to build the background and technical skills required to contribute to the **AMS-02 (Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer)** cosmic-ray experiment led by **Prof. Bilge Demirköz** at METU IVMER.  

The project combines **physics fundamentals**, **data science**, and **machine-learning methods** for cosmic-ray analysis and sensor data interpretation.

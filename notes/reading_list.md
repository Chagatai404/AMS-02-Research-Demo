# 📚 AMS-02 Reading List

This document tracks the papers and resources I am studying to build a solid understanding of AMS-02 physics, detector subsystems, and cosmic-ray analysis.

## ⭐ Paper List (Week 1)

### **1. AMS-02 in space: physics results, overview, and challenges**  
**Nicola Tomassetti (2015)**  
*Nuclear and Particle Physics Proceedings 265–266, pp. 245–247*  
📄 *Personal annotated PDF in repo* (uploaded as: `AMS-02 physics results, overview, and challenges_251121_130512.pdf`) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

**Why this paper matters:**  
- Gives a **complete overview** of the AMS-02 detector on the ISS.  
- Explains the purpose of each subdetector (TRD, TOF, Tracker, RICH, ECAL).  
- Shows how AMS distinguishes leptons vs hadrons using **redundant systems**.  
- Presents **lepton flux measurements (1–500 GeV)** and their implications.  
- Discusses **challenges** such as:
  - charge-confusion  
  - detector calibration  
  - systematic uncertainties  
  - solar modulation effects  
- Introduces the main open physics questions:
  - What sources cause the rise in positron fraction at high energies?
  - Is it dark matter annihilation or nearby astrophysical objects **(PWNe/SNRs)**?
  - How do we constrain propagation models with **B/C ratios**?

**Key Figures to revisit later:**  
- *Figure 1*: AMS-02 subsystem layout (page 2)  
- *Figure 2*: Positron fraction vs energy (page 3)

# 🌌 AMS-02 & Cosmic Ray Glossary
Short, working definitions so I can talk to physicists without getting lost :D.

## 🧱 Core Physics & Particles

### **Cosmic ray**
High-energy charged particle arriving from space (mostly protons, plus helium, electrons, heavier nuclei, and a small fraction of antiparticles).

### **Primary vs secondary cosmic rays**
- **Primary**: particles accelerated in astrophysical sources (e.g., supernovae).  
- **Secondary**: products of interactions of primaries with interstellar gas or Earth’s atmosphere.

### **Dark matter (in this context)**
Hypothetical form of matter that does not emit light but affects gravity. AMS-02 searches for indirect signatures (e.g., excess antiprotons or positrons in the flux).

## ⚛️ Kinematics & Motion in Magnetic Fields

### **Charge (q)**
Determines how strongly a particle feels electromagnetic forces and in which direction it bends in a magnetic field (sign).

### **Momentum (p)**
“Inertia in motion.” For relativistic particles:

$$
p \approx \gamma m v
$$

### **Rigidity (R)**
Momentum per unit charge. Defined as:

$$
R = \frac{p}{|Z|e}
$$

AMS-02 often reports measurements in rigidity rather than raw momentum.

### **Lorentz force**
Force on a charged particle in a magnetic field:

$$
\vec{F} = q \, \vec{v} \times \vec{B}
$$

This leads to circular or helical motion.

### **Curvature radius (r)**
In a uniform magnetic field:

$$
r = \frac{p}{|q|B}
$$

Measuring curvature \(r\) → estimate momentum \(p\).  
Direction of curvature → determines charge sign.

## 📐 Detector & Measurement Concepts

### **Flux (Φ)**
Number of particles per unit area, per unit time, per unit solid angle, per unit energy (or rigidity):

$$
\Phi \approx \frac{N_{\text{signal}}}{A \cdot T \cdot \epsilon \cdot \Delta E}
$$

### **Acceptance (A)**
Effective area
